### Factory Design Pattern: Key Concepts

1. **Definition**: The Factory Design Pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying their concrete classes, promoting loose coupling. Instead of directly using constructors, a factory method or class creates the objects. This keeps the code flexible, hides the complexity of object creation, and makes it easier to add new object types in the future.

2. **Purpose**: It hides the instantiation logic, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

3. **Components**:
   - **Factory**: A class or method responsible for creating objects.
   - **Product**: The interface or abstract class representing the objects to be created.
   - **Concrete Product**: Specific implementations of the Product interface.

4. **When to Use**:
   - When the client code doesn’t need to know the exact class of the objects it uses.
   - When creating objects involves complex logic that shouldn’t clutter the client code.

5. **Benefits**:
   - Reduces tight coupling.
   - Simplifies object creation logic.
