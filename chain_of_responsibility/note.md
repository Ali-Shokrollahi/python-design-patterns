### Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern: Key Concepts

- **Purpose**: Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

- **Components**:
  1. **Handler Interface/Abstract Class**: Declares a method to handle the request.
  2. **Concrete Handlers**: Implements the handling logic and passes the request onward if needed.
  3. **Client**: Sends the request to the first handler in the chain.

    
- **Key Idea**: The **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern allows multiple objects to handle a request without the sender needing to know which object will process it.

### Use Case:
When you have multiple handlers, and the request must be processed by one of them **dynamically**.

### Real-Life Analogy:
Customer support levels (e.g., chatbot → agent → manager). If one can't solve an issue, it is passed to the next.
