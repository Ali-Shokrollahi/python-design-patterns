### State Design Pattern: Key Concepts

- **Purpose**: The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, making it appear as though the object has changed its class.

- **Components**:
  1. **Context**: The main object whose behavior depends on its state. It delegates state-specific behavior to the current state object.
  2. **State Interface**: Defines the methods that all concrete states must implement.
  3. **Concrete States**: Implement specific behavior corresponding to a particular state of the Context.

- **Key Idea**: Encapsulate state-specific behaviors into separate classes and allow the context to switch between these states dynamically.

- **Benefits**:
  - Promotes Single Responsibility and Open/Closed Principles.
  - Simplifies complex conditional logic.
  - Enhances scalability by adding new states without modifying existing code.

- **Example**: A media player with states like "Playing", "Paused", and "Stopped", where each state defines its own behavior for actions like play, pause, or stop.
