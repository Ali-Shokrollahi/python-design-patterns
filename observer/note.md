### Observer Design Pattern: Key Concepts

- **Definition**: Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

- **Key Components**:
  1. **Subject**: Maintains a list of observers and provides methods to add/remove them. Notifies observers of any changes.
  2. **Observer**: Defines an interface for receiving updates from the subject.
  3. **Concrete Subject**: Implements the subject interface and manages its state.
  4. **Concrete Observer**: Implements the observer interface and responds to subject updates.

- **Common Uses**: 
  - Event handling in GUIs.
  - Real-time updates like live stock prices or chat apps.
  - Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

- **Pros**:
  - Promotes loose coupling between subject and observers.
  - Makes it easy to add new observers without modifying the subject.

- **Cons**:
  - Can lead to memory leaks if observers are not removed properly.
  - Potentially costly updates if many observers exist or frequent notifications occur.
