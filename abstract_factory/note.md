### Abstract Factory Design Pattern: Key Concepts

- **Definition**: Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Encapsulates a group of factories with a common theme.
  - Ensures that products from the same family are compatible with each other.
  - Promotes consistency by forcing object creation through a factory interface.

- **Structure**:
  1. **Abstract Factory**: Declares interfaces for creating abstract products.
  2. **Concrete Factory**: Implements the creation of specific product variants.
  3. **Abstract Products**: Declares interfaces for product types.
  4. **Concrete Products**: Implements specific product variants.

- **Use Case**: When the system should be independent of how its objects are created and when working with multiple families of related products.

- **Analogy**: Think of a furniture shop that offers modern or Victorian-style furniture. The shop ensures that all furniture in a set (chair, sofa, table) matches the chosen style.
